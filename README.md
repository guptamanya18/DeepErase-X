# VisEraseNet 🚀
**Multimodal AI-Powered Framework for Seamless Text and Object Removal**

---

## Overview
In the digital era, the demand for **automated content moderation**, **copyright protection**, and **video post-processing** is rapidly increasing.  
**VisEraseNet** introduces a **multimodal deep learning framework** that intelligently detects, segments, and removes unwanted logos, texts, and objects from images and videos — achieving high-quality, context-aware restorations without artifacts.

Unlike traditional methods relying on basic detection or naive inpainting, **VisEraseNet** seamlessly integrates:
- **YOLO-based object detection**
- **OCR-driven text recognition**
- **Semantic segmentation**
- **Advanced deep-learning-based inpainting**

for **scalable, real-time** object and text removal with minimal distortions.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🔎 **Precise Object & Text Detection:**  
  YOLO and OCR-assisted detection for logos, subtitles, and texts.
  
- 🎨 **Context-Aware Mask Generation:**  
  Hybrid masks created using **Detectron2** and **TextFuseNet** to focus only on unwanted regions.

- 🛠️ **Deep Learning Inpainting:**  
  LaMa model intelligently reconstructs missing parts, preserving structural and texture consistency.

- ⚡ **Real-Time Frame Processing:**  
  Asynchronous parallel execution for **high-speed performance** on high-resolution videos.

- 🔥 **Multimodal Feature Extraction:**  
  Character-level, word-level, and global scene features ensure **fine-grained** mask accuracy.

## 📈 Pipeline Overview

1. **Video Frame Extraction**  
   ➔ Frames extracted at a consistent FPS rate using OpenCV.

2. **Object & Text Detection**  
   ➔ YOLO detects logos and unwanted objects.  
   ➔ OCR and TextFuseNet detect and refine text regions.

3. **Mask Generation and Refinement**  
   ➔ Multi-level feature fusion (character, word, global) to generate precise masks.

4. **Inpainting and Reconstruction**  
   ➔ LaMa model reconstructs the removed areas with visually coherent content.
